    /// Called on the list of lookups the circuit defines.
    ///
    /// While generating IR in a circuit with multiple lookups it could be the case that two
    /// lookups are related. For example, the circuit could call the same lookup in the same row
    /// for two values. The client that is extracting the circuit may want to handle these pairs of
    /// lookups in a special manner. This method enables the possibility for callbacks of handling
    /// the lookups in the circuit as a whole. With only calls to [`LookupCallbacks::on_lookup`]
    /// for each lookup is not possible to do that since the callback would receive each
    /// lookup indepedently.
    ///
    /// For example, consider a lookup for a sha256 implementation that returns the plain and
    /// spreaded version of a value (i.e. for 5 the spreaded value would be 17) and for each row where
    /// the lookup is enabled it invokes it twice (returning spreaded values `x` and `y`).
    /// For verifying with Picus, it helps annotating that if `x + 2*y` is deterministic, then `x`
    /// and `y` are deterministic. Emitting IR that encodes that axiom requires working with both
    /// lookups (each would be a different [`Lookup`]) at the same time.
    ///
    /// The implementation of this method is optional if the callback does not need to do any
    /// inter-lookup work and by default loops over the lookups and calls [`LookupCallbacks::on_lookup`] on each.
